Pacman Exercise
This project is a in-browser Pacman spawner. Add as many Pacmen as you like to the scene, and they will move randomly!

How to Run: Download the repository files on computer. Make sure all the files are included (Images, .html file, & .js file). Once downloaded, simply run the .html file in your browser. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Adding randomized colors to Pacmen, styling the interface using a CSS file to look more modern.
